# Titanic Survival Prediction ‚Äì Beginner ML Project

This project explores the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not. It was developed as a beginner-level portfolio project for learning data science and machine learning fundamentals.

## Project Goals

- Load and explore the Titanic dataset
- Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, drop irrelevant columns)
- Train and evaluate classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- Compare model performance
- Learn best practices for data science workflows

## Project Structure
This project is organized as follows:

titanic-survival-prediction/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/ ‚Üê Contains raw data (train.csv). This folder is ignored by GitHub using .gitignore.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notebook.ipynb ‚Üê Jupyter notebook containing code for data cleaning, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚Üê Project overview and documentation.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore ‚Üê Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git (e.g., data/ and .ipynb_checkpoints)

## Models Tested

| Model               | Accuracy | F1 Score (Survived) |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------|
| Logistic Regression| 0.80     | 0.76                |
| Decision Tree      | 0.72     | 0.67                |

Logistic Regression gave the best overall performance.
